# OpenAI API Configuration
# To enable AI-powered intent matching for ambiguous queries, 
# add your OpenAI API key here:
# VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Example:
# VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef...

# Note: The system will work without this key, falling back to 
# rule-based responses. The AI feature enhances user experience
# by better understanding unclear or complex queries.
